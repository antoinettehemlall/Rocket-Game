# Space Game

This game was created based on exercise 12-4 from the book Python Crash Course, by Eric Matthes.

This program creates a game window with a white background and loads a spaceship in the center of the screen.
The player can move the ship up, down, left, or right using the arrow keys.

The purpose of this game is to utilize each arrow key as input, while also keeping the movement of the ship within the fixed game window.
